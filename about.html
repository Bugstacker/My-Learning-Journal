            <h2>Hi there! My name is Kenneth and welcome to my learning journal.</h2>
            <p>After two months of learning in the Frontend development, I've decided to share my journey and how it has been so far to those who want join this field of software development.</p>

          <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
          <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner I've spent and still spending hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects. While this was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share waht I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>

          <p>What fuels my learning is first of all the passion I have for technology and computers as a whole, secondly is mirroring the past, present & the future goals and correlate them to match my goals and preferences. So everything in the niche of my goals is something I dont</p>

        <article class="about-article">
          <h3>How I got started</h3>
          <p>I started simple and gradually with <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freecodeCamp</a> where I acquired my certificate in responsive design. Although felt like I needed an interactive course and after some like a week of research and watching tutorials I finally decided to enroll in <a href="https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/" target="_blank">Conquering Responsive layouts</a> by <a href="https://courses.kevinpowell.co/" target="_blank">Kevin Powell</a> which in my opinion is the best decision after freecodecamp where I acquired so much knowledge about responsive layouts interactively and doing numerous challenges.</p>

          <P>After acquiring enough knowledge about the styles and markup language I went on a hunt of learning Javascript, this is after some good research I got to know about <a href="https://scrimba.com/" target="_blank">Scrimba</a> and guess what its the best place so far and I wished if I knew it earlier whereby even Kevin Powell is one of the teachers. I am currently their Frontend career path student just finished my 6th/12 module and I believe they have made me a better student since most of the projects ahve built them from when I became their student.</p>

          <p>From the beginning I always take notes about what I am learning After each learning lesson, I use my notes to not only reflect on what I have learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>

          <p>That has helped me grok what I am learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others to learn and stay motivated.</p>
