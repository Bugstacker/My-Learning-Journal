          <h2>My new journey as front-end web developer student</h2>
          <p>After two months as a Frontend web Developer student with <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">Freecodecamp</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyFWoLmPTgZ3BkHIKMRSV1g" target="_blank">Nerd lessons</a> & <a href="https://courses.kevinpowell.co/" target="_blank">Kevin Powell</a> the CSS evangelist, currently a <a href="https://scrimba.com/" target="_blank">Scrimba</a> Pro Student. I've managed to build some projects which am excited to share with the world as well motivate fellow aspirers who want to get into this field
            to come and join me on this adventure.</p>

          <h3>What is Frontend Web Development in my own words</h3>
          <p>It is the ability for someone to design responsive web applications from scratch. This involves using <em>HTML</em> (HyperText Markup Language) to write the webpages, <em>CSS</em> (Cascading StyleSheets) & finally <em>Javascript</em> and its libraries with a sole purpose of making these webpages interactive.</p>

          <p>Frontend development ca be really fun if you're someone who loves legit stuff and customizing it to your own preferences. <a href="https://scrimba.com/" target="_blank">Scrimba</a> is the best place to start with their front-end career path.</p>

          <h3>How I manage to build these projects</h3>
          <p>Getting introduced to anew concept and start building projects right away understanding what each line of code does is something not easy but if you first of all have the passion then you can combine it with your future goals if they correlate then you have the fuel to keep you going.</p>

          <p><em>A special thanks to Scrimba since 90% of my projects they are due to the fact that am with them and they have helped and still firming what I already know and that I dont kniw into my grasp Not forgetting the discord community which is a vibe ðŸ™Œ.</em></p>

        <p>In my journey have so far managed to mimick designs of two famous applications that is twitter and instagram and the clones are <strong><a href="https:/https://github.com/Bugstacker/Leads-Tracker-Extension-for-Chrome" target="_blank">Twimba</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https:/https://github.com/Bugstacker/Oldagram" target="_blank">Oldagram</a></strong> respectively and it amazes to see how these apps behave behind the scenes and aslo check the hustle these billionaires went through for their apps to be valued at billions rightnow.</p>
